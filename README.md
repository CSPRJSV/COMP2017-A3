Task description

Introducing ProgExchange (PEX), a cutting-edge platform for computer programmers to buy and sell high-demand components in a virtual marketplace. The need for in-person trading has been replaced by a state-of-the-art digital marketplace, allowing for greater accessibility and faster transactions, while providing a safe and convenient way for seasoned programmers to connect and make transactions.

As part of this assignment, you will be tasked with developing two key components of ProgExchange: the exchange itself, which will handle all incoming orders, and an auto-trading program that executes trades based on predeﬁned conditions. With your expertise in systems programming, you will play a crucial role in bringing this innovative platform to life and helping to drive the future of computer component trading.

You are encouraged to ask questions on Ed 1 . Make sure your question post is of "Question" post type and is under "Assignment" category → "A3" subcategory. As with any assignment, make sure that your work is your own 2 , and that you do not share your code or solutions with other students.

• Dynamic memory allocation: malloc(), realloc(), free(), etc

• open(), read(), write() system calls

• Processes: fork(), exec(), waitpid(), etc

• Signals: sigaction(), kill(), etc
